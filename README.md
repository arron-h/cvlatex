# Arron Hartley's LaTeX CV Source

This repository contains the content of my CV in LaTeX form. [**Awesome CV**](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) is used as a template for the design and is linked as a submodule.

## Quick Start

* Make sure the latest, full package of TeXLive is installed and setup correctly.
* Clone this repo and initialise the Awesome CV submodule
* Run the following command:

```bash
$ xelatex arron_hartley_cv.tex
```

Note that ``xelatex`` must be used instead of ``pdflatex`` due to requirements.

## Credit

[**Awesome CV**](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) for the great template.
