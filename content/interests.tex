I have a passionate interest in video games, which has been longstanding since the early 90s and my fatherâ€™s Atari
ST 520. Since then I have played games from many genres on many different platforms and have amassed a collection of
favourite titles during this time. Naturally I also enjoy creating video games having produced a number of graphics
demos, video games and hobbyist code on my spare time.

My other interests are somewhat more active than software development; I am an avid cyclist and I enjoy outdoor
activities such as camping, nature photography, hiking and astronomy when weather permits.

\begin{cvparagraph}

I believe my more technical-based interests reflect upon my character in that I have a keen attention to detail.
My interest in the outdoors has provided me with the experience of having to work together with friends to accomplish a
shared goal and to adapt to changing conditions quickly.
